Things that need to be done...

... as always, mostly outdated.

0. Fix that ugly crash that happens sometimes when Ctrl+C-ing with jack output active:

1. mpg123 could pick up new sample rates suggested by the output modules (like a jack server fixed to 96kHz) and adapt to that.

Though the practical rates for MPEG audio are up to 48kHz ... but one could easily upsample.
Currently, we detect standard rates and resample when needed... but not new ones.

2. What's about SINGLE_MIX?
Check what is _really_ happening there, make some test file...
